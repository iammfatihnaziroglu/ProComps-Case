## ProComps Case Project.

## npm install

### First of all, thank you for this opportunity. It's been a long time since I left my previous company, so I feel a bit rusty and slowed down when it comes to coding. I have a few shortcomings in this case, but I actually know how to do them; I just ran out of time during the case study. However, from my commit time, you can see my potential and how committed I am to this job/internship. I look forward to hearing from you after your assessment.

Best Regards.
